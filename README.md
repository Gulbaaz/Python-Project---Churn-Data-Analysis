# 📉 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Python EDA Project)

This project explores customer churn behavior in a telecom company using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
The goal is to identify key factors that drive customer churn and derive actionable retention strategies.

The analysis covers demographics, contract types, payment methods, tenure, and service-related attributes.  
All insights are derived from Python-based data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration.

# 📌 Objective
Understand **why customers churn**, identify the strongest churn predictors, and propose data-backed retention strategies.  
The analysis uses EDA techniques such as distribution analysis, churn segmentation, correlation checks, and factor comparison.

# 🔍 **Key Insights From EDA**

### **1️⃣ Contract Type & Churn**
- **Month-to-month contracts → 42% churn**  
- **1-year contracts → 11% churn**  
- **2-year contracts → only 3% churn**  
➡️ *Long-term contracts significantly reduce churn.*  

---

### **2️⃣ Payment Method & Churn**
- **Electronic check users churn the most — 45%**  
- Credit card, bank transfer, mailed check customers → **15–18% churn**  
➡️ *Electronic payment issues may create distrust; shifting users to stable methods can reduce churn.*  

---

### **3️⃣ Tenure & Churn**
- **< 1 year tenure → 50% churn**  
- **1–3 years → 35% churn**  
- **> 3 years → only 15% churn**  
➡️ *Early customer experience is critical.*  

---

### **4️⃣ Internet Service Type**
- Fiber Optic customers → **30% churn**  
- DSL customers → **20% churn**  
➡️ *Likely due to higher expectations or service dissatisfaction.*  

---

### **5️⃣ Senior Citizens & Churn**
- Senior citizens (65+) → **41% churn**  
- Non-seniors → **26%**  
➡️ *They need targeted assistance and support programs.*

- Age-wise churn distribution (senior vs non-senior)  
- Correlation heatmap  

(All plots are available inside the **Images/** folder.)

# 🎯 Recommendations

### ✔ Promote Long-Term Contracts  
Offer discounts or bundled plans to shift customers off month-to-month plans.

### ✔ Fix Electronic Check Churn Issue  
Encourage movement toward credit/bank payments through offers or messaging.

### ✔ Improve Early Tenure Experience  
Allocate support teams to new customers during their first year.

### ✔ Senior-Focused Retention Programs  
Dedicated helpdesk, priority support, or simplified plans for customers aged 65+.
